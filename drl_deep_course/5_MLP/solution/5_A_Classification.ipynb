    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore a non-linear classification problem using a synthetic dataset. This dataset consists of two classes arranged in opposite corners of a 2D space:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Class 0 occupies the upper-left and lower-right quadrants.\n",
    "* Class 1 occupies the lower-left and upper-right quadrants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike linearly separable datasets, this pattern creates a non-linear decision boundary. Traditional linear classifiers like logistic regression struggle with such data because a straight line cannot effectively separate the classes. Instead, we’ll explore how adding a hidden layer in the neural network can be used to classify this dataset accurately by learning a complex, non-linear decision boundary.\n",

    "**Tasks:**\n",

    "First, we start with the data generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initially, use the simple, linear separable data set. Go once through the different steps (this is the simple Neural Network model with sigmoid activation) and look at the results.\n",
    "* Second, switch to the four blob data set (in the section below, you have to uncomment the line that assigns four centers). You can switch to the non-linear classification task by adding more centers for generating the data. \n",

You likely observed that this single-layer neural network struggled to classify the data effectively. A simple neural network with only one layer and a linear decision boundary can only separate classes that are linearly separable. This means it can only classify data effectively if the classes can be divided by straight lines (or planes in higher dimensions). However, the four blobs are arranged in a way that requires non-linear separation to classify correctly.

    "## 5.A.3 Multi-Layer Perceptron: Introducing Layers that \"Learn\" Features \n",
    "\n",
    "A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of neural network that consists of an input layer, one (or more) hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer is made up of nodes, or neurons, which are connected to the neurons in the subsequent layer. MLPs are considered \"fully connected\" neural networks, meaning every neuron in one layer connects to every neuron in the next layer. MLPs are commonly used for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Bishop_5_1_notation.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In each layer, the network processes the input data by applying a linear transformation (through weights and biases) followed by a non-linear activation function (like the sigmoid function). The model \"learns\" by adjusting the weights and biases through a process called backpropagation, which minimizes the error between the model's predictions and the true values. This is done by calculating the error gradients and using an optimization technique like gradient descent to update the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you’ll implement parts of an MLP, focusing, first, on extending the forward pass to generate predictions. Secondly,  you will adapt the backward pass for learning through weight updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute the Forward Pass: Given an input, extend the forward pass through the network. Use the provided weights and activation function to compute the output of each neuron. Pass the input data through each layer to calculate the final output of the network.\n",
    "* Implement the Backward Pass: Starting from the loss, which is provided as Mean Squared Error (MSE), calculate the gradients (deltas) for each layer.\n",
    "Given is already computation of the gradient of the output layer (as you have done before in the tasks). Work backwards to find the gradients of the hidden layers. Use these gradients to update the weights for each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The gradient for the loss has already been computed, so you’ll start from this point.\n",
    "* Use the chain rule to calculate the \"delta\" values that propagate backwards through each layer.\n",
    "* Ensure to update the weights at each layer based on the calculated deltas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup will allow you to test each layer individually to verify the accuracy of your implementation. Let’s get started with the forward pass, and then move on to the backward pass for training (and test this layer wise).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analyse:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Test the different hyperparameters in your implementation: Learning rate, number of neurons in the hidden layer, initialization of weigths. What do you observe? And what do you learn from that? Do you have ideas how to improve the methods?"
