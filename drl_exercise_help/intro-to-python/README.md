# Learning goals
At the end of this Intro, you will ...

* know how to write Python code;
* know the (dis)advantages of Python relative to other programming languages;
* understand the concept of "object-oriented programming";
* be able to create basic Python scripts;
* be able to implement basic data processing operations and visualization using [*numpy*](https://numpy.org/) and [*matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/);

Importantly, this course focuses on the *basics* of Python, but we have highlighted several resources that you may use to continue your Python:
- https://docs.python.org/3.10/contents.html

For a fast and intuitive overview of common functionalities, you can refer to the following cheat sheets:
- [Numpy](https://assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Numpy_Python_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/cheatsheets/)
