    "In this notebook, we will introduce you to the basics of programming in Python. We will explain how to work with Jupyter notebooks, contrast \"interactive programming\" with \"scripting\", and introduce you to the concept of object-oriented programming. Importantly, we believe that programming is best learned by *doing it*, so this notebook will feature a lot of (ungraded) exercises. Because students often differ in how much experience they have with programming, the exercises are often relatively easy. However, to challenge those more familiar with programming, we also include (optional!) more difficult exercises. The concepts discussed in these exercises will not be featured on the exam and/or graded assignments.\n",

    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "So, what are Jupyter notebooks, actually? Basically, using Jupyter notebooks is like using the web-browser as a kind of editor from which you can run Python code, similar to the MATLAB interactive editor or RStudio. Just like any editor, code in Jupyter notebooks is interpreted and executed by Python on your computer (or on a remote server) and their results are returned to the notebook for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cool thing about these notebooks is that they allow you to mix code \"cells\" (see below) and text \"cells\" (such as this one). The (printed) output from code blocks are displayed right below the code blocks themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have two *modes*: edit mode and command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Command mode* is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin (as is the case now!): When you are in command mode, you are able to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells. Most importantly, in command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently (some shortcuts in command mode will be discussed later!). Enter command mode by pressing **Esc** or using the mouse to click outside a cell’s editor area; <br><br>\n",
    "- *Edit mode* is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area: When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor. Enter edit mode by pressing Enter or using the mouse to double-click on a cell’s editor area.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're reading and scrolling through the tutorials, you'll be in the command mode mostly. But once you have to program (or write) stuff yourself, you have to switch to edit mode. But we'll get to that. First, we'll explain something about the two types of cells: code cells and text cells."

In short, any Python file (i.e., a file with the extension `.py`) can be either a *script* or a *module*, and whether it is one or the other depends on how you use the file. In short, scripts are Python files that contain code that actually *does* something (e.g., compute the average of a series of numbers, clean up a messy excel file, etc.) while modules only contain code that *define* things.\n",

The script computes the average of two (predefined) numbers (i.e., it *does* something). The module file only *defines* a function (`average`). Indeed, if you'd run the script, several things will be done (i.e., the average of `a` and `b` will be computed and the result will be printed), but if you'd run the module, nothing will happen."

Python doesn't care whether you think a file is a script or a module &mdash; it just sees and runs a `.py` file. Why would *you* care, then? Well, because it allows you to organize your code in a sensible and efficient manner, where modules may define operations that may be used across different scripts. In the example script and module discussed previously, we actually did something similar by \"importing\" functionality from the module in the script file! (Imports will be discussed at length in the next notebook.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a more practical example, in my own research projects I often have a single `analysis.py` *script* which I run when I want to (re)run my analysis. This script uses functionality from different modules, such as `preprocessing.py` and `visualization.py`. This way, the analysis script stays relatively short and readable, abstracting away from the different operations defined in the modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this distinction between scripts and modules is only conceptual. Nothing is stopping you from writing all your code in one single file! For example, the `average` function definition from the `example_module.py` module could also have been directly included in the `example_script.py` script; nothing wrong with that. But understanding the difference between these two types of files and organizing your code accordingly will undoubtely lead to cleaner, better readable code in the long run, especially for large projects!"
